## Development

### IMPORTANT: Please use node v17.2.0.

To run the local development server (not the extension):

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build the /out directory and run the extension locally:

```bash
npm run dev:extension
```

Navigate to chrome://extensions/ and click "Load unpacked" and select the /out directory.
